mentation
[Pyoncord](https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny) documentation on everything p=
lugin and theme related, for regular users and developers alike

&gt; [!NOTE]=20
&gt; There is also a **complete list of compatible themes** with Pyoncord a=
t the bottom of this  guide


# Broken plugins
This is an extensive list of every plugin from Vendetta you should uninstal=
l (sob).

Confirmed broken plugins:


Causes crashing-

RolesColourEverywhere (Show in members list setting specifically causes cra=
sh), CustomTimestamps (causes crash) and other EOL'd plugins

Doesn't work-

CustomUserTags-cuc, CustomTags, Fakeavatar, Betterfolders, ReverseImageSear=
ch, Picturelinks, HideServers, AlwaysAnimate, NoCompression, SquareProfileP=
ics, localpins, PinSettings, SplitMessages, realmoji, stealmoji, systeminfo=
, messagelogger (buggy), nodelete (buggy) &lt;br&gt;
## Plugin guide

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you used [CloudSync](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/vendetta.ne=
xpid.xyz/cloud-sync/) on Vendetta, you should reinstall it and import your =
plugins. It is simply recommended looking at this guide for new ones you ma=
y like, and if a plugin is broken in case you have issues. (list provided a=
bove)

&gt; First and foremost, if you are on the [discord server](https://discord=
.gg/pyoncord), look in the #faq channel for basic info on how to install pl=
ugins and/or themes. It won't be explained here, so please make sure you di=
d.

Use the [plugin web browser](https://vd-plugins.github.io/web/#) for this.=
=20

The first batch is [HideGiftButton](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/amsy=
arasyiq.github.io/letup/HideGiftButton/), [HideAppButton](https://rico040.g=
ithub.io/bunny-plugins/hideappbutton/) (optionally) and [HideVoiceButton](h=
ttps://aliernfrog.github.io/vd-plugins/HideVoiceButton/). &lt;br&gt;
All of the above make the **chatbox** not an absolute mess.* &lt;br&gt;
You can also add [ChatboxAvatar](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/cynosph=
ere.github.io/VendettaPlugins/ChatboxAvatar/) for a pfp and easy way to you=
r profile within the chatbox.

&gt; preview of the result (with chatbox avatar) and custom iconpack

&lt;img src=3D"https://github.com/rennpy/pyonguide/assets/158360149/f610bc0=
b-6183-453e-b1b8-6be19c0a4a29" width=3D"600"&gt;

*(I'm looking at you, discord)=20

Next up, [themes+](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/fres621.github.io/ven=
detta-plugins/BetterSearch/) is a must-have for **theme enjoyers**. If you =
want a way to set-up iconpacks for any theme, some are included within the =
plugin settings or you can use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.co=
m/rairof/discord-iconpacks/master/Packs/Plumpy/) for a fixed version of ros=
iecord plumpy! (dont use a suffix and remove the / at the start which theme=
s+ weirdly does by default)

&gt; preview of pyontheme using fixed iconpack

6-0e66-429c-8c5b-9da65635c1a6" width=3D"200" height=3D"350"&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Lastly, for **better privacy**, I recommend another set of plugins, being [=
CleanUrls](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/vendetta.nexpid.xyz/clean-url=
s/), [HideTyping](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/redstonekasi.github.io=
/vendetta-plugins/no-typing/) and [AnonymousFileNames](https://vd-plugins.g=
ithub.io/proxy/maisymoe.github.io/strife/AnonymousFileNames/)

## Additional plugins

The rest of these dont matter as much, but I'll still list them here, since=
 you may find something you like.

**FREE nitro** stuff which is=20
[Realmoji](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/redstonekasi.github.io/vendet=
ta-plugins/realmoji/)=20
[Freemoji](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/maisymoe.github.io/strife/Fre=
emoji/), [Freestickers](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/aliernfrog.githu=
b.io/vd-plugins/FreeStickers/), [Freecons](https://vd-plugins.github.io/pro=
xy/dziurwa14.github.io/vendetta-plugins/Freecons/), [FreeProfileColors](htt=
ps://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/twnlink.github.io/vendetta-plugins/FreeProf=
ileColors/) and [Decor](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/decor-discord.gi=
thub.io/vendetta-plugin/)

![image](https://github.com/rennpy/pyonguide/assets/158360149/f21f4185-6fb0=
-4324-bff4-852bb72a66aa)

If you want brainrot you can use [ReviewDB](https://janisslsm.github.io/vdp=
lugins/ReviewDB/), [UwUify](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/exhq.github.=
io/vendetta/uwuify/) or even a buggy [MessageLogger](https://angelix1.githu=
b.io/VP/message_logger/) (to stalk people)

I know all of you wanted these so, why not?

## Theme guide=20

Here you can find most of the themes working with Pyoncord (more will be ad=
ded in the future) and some quick links for theme developers.

If this is your first time using a client mod, I suggest that you try [Pyon=
theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rennpy/pyontheme/main/pyontheme.js=
on) (honestly, this is my guide so I can showcase what I want =F0=9F=9A=8E)=
 &lt;br&gt;
You can be sure it will always work for most recent versions of Pyoncord, n=
aturally.

Here is a link to the [github page](https://github.com/rennpy/pyontheme) fo=
r it, which includes a preview.

**Theme list:**

[Orchid's love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VodkaXMartini/VendettaThe=
me/main/Orchid.json) by ftvodka &lt;br&gt;
[Eye Candy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Quinxxxx/Discord-themes/main/=
Vendetta/Eye_candy.json) by moodle &lt;br&gt;
[RosieBlue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moodzz1/DT/main/Vendetta/Rosi=
eBlue.json) by moodle &lt;br&gt;
[Atherion 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LYNK-INCUU/Cosmicka/main/A=
etherion-Vendetta.json) by Lyntxrya#7769 &lt;br&gt;
[Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/vendetta) (link to all variants)=
 &lt;br&gt;
[Maggie's purple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maggster165/vendettathe=
mes/main/maggiespurple.json) by maggie.pi (little of it needs fixing)

### For theme developers

If you are a theme dev or want to try theme-making, you should look at the =
[theme docs](https://docs.riichi.tech/) from riichi (kinda outdated) &lt;br=
&gt;
And most importantly [ThemeLings](https://github.com/nexpid/Themelings) by =
nexpid which is used to find new icons discord changes or adds &lt;br&gt;
You should also join the discord if you haven't already and ask in #theme-d=
ev if you need help with anything.
