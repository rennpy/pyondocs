Here is a simple guide to get you started with indepth customization of your pyoncord install.  

> First and foremost, if you are in our discord (.gg/pyoncord), look in the #faq channel for basic info on how to install plugins or themes. I wont explain that here, so please understand this first.

Okay, so first thing you should do is install some very important plugins. Use the plugin web browser on the discord for this. The first one is [hidegiftbutton](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/amsyarasyiq.github.io/letup/HideGiftButton/) (who uses those anyway) and optionally [hideappbutton](https://rico040.github.io/bunny-plugins/hideappbutton/). Both of these make your chatbox cleaner.
