# Pyoncord-guide
Here is an organized guide to get you started with in-depth customization of your [Pyoncord](https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny) install.

> First and foremost, if you are in our [discord](https://discord.gg/pyoncord), look in the #faq channel for basic info on how to install plugins or themes. I wont explain that here, so please understand this first.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you used [cloudsync](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/vendetta.nexpid.xyz/cloud-sync/) on Vendetta, you should reinstall it and import your plugins. I simply recommend looking at this guide for new ones you may like, and if a plugin is broken in case you have issues. (list provided below)

# Broken plugins
This is an extensive list of every plugin from Vendetta you should uninstall (sob).

Confirmed broken plugins:

Causes crash-
RolesColourEverywhere (Show in members list setting specifically causes crash), Custom Timestamps (causes crash), FileContentPreview (causes crash), Platform indicator(causes crash in DMs), Angel utils (causes crash when holding down messages)

Dosen't work-
Custom User Tags-cuc, Custom Tags, Fakeavatar, Betterfolders, Reverse Image search, Picture links, HideServers, AlwaysAnimate, No compression, SquareProfilePics, local pins, Pin settings, split messages, realmoji, stealmoji, system info, message logger (buggy), nodelete (buggy)
## #1

So first thing you should do is install some very neat plugins. 

Use the [plugin web browser](https://vd-plugins.github.io/web/#) for this. 

The first batch is [HideGiftButton](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/amsyarasyiq.github.io/letup/HideGiftButton/), [HideAppButton](https://rico040.github.io/bunny-plugins/hideappbutton/) (optionally) and [HideVoiceButton](https://aliernfrog.github.io/vd-plugins/HideVoiceButton/).
All of these will make your chatbox not look like an absolute mess. 
(I'm looking at you, discord) 

Next up, [themes+](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/fres621.github.io/vendetta-plugins/BetterSearch/) is a must have for **theme enjoyers**. If you want a way to set-up iconpacks for any theme, some are included within the plugin settings or you can use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rairof/discord-iconpacks/master/Packs/Plumpy/) for a fixed version of rosiecord plumpy! (dont use a suffix and remove the / at the start which themes+ weirdly does by default)

For **more privacy**, I recommend another set of plugins, being [CleanUrls](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/vendetta.nexpid.xyz/clean-urls/), [HideTyping](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/redstonekasi.github.io/vendetta-plugins/no-typing/) and [AnonymousFileNames](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/maisymoe.github.io/strife/AnonymousFileNames/)

Another set of plugins I will show here is for **FREE nitro**. The list consists of [Realmoji](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/redstonekasi.github.io/vendetta-plugins/realmoji/), [Freemoji](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/maisymoe.github.io/strife/Freemoji/), [Freestickers](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/aliernfrog.github.io/vd-plugins/FreeStickers/), [Freecons](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/dziurwa14.github.io/vendetta-plugins/Freecons/) and finally [FreeProfileColors](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/twnlink.github.io/vendetta-plugins/FreeProfileColors/)

I know all of you wanted these, so why not put them here.

Lastly, I also recommend trying [Pyontheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rennpy/pyontheme/main/pyontheme.json) (honestly, this is my guide so I can showcase what I want ðŸšŽ also you can be sure it will always work for most recent version)

Here is a link to the [github page](https://github.com/rennpy/pyontheme) for it, which includes a preview.
