# Pyonguide
Here is a simple guide to get you started with indepth customization of your pyoncord install.  

> First and foremost, if you are in our discord (.gg/pyoncord), look in the #faq channel for basic info on how to install plugins or themes. I wont explain that here, so please understand this first.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you used cloudsync on vendetta, I recommend doing that to use what you had prior. I simply recommend looking at this guide for new plugins you may like, and of course those which are broken. (provided below)

# Broken plugins
here is an extensive list of every plugin from vendetta you should unfortunately uninstall.

Confirmed broken plugins:
RolesColourEverywhere (Show in members list setting specifically causes crash), Custom Timestamps (causes crash), FileContentPreview (causes crash), Platform indicator(causes crash in DMs), Custom User Tags-cuc, Custom Tags, Fakeavatar, Betterfolders, Reverse Image search, Picture links, HideServers, AlwaysAnimate, No compression, SquareProfilePics, local pins, Pin settings, split messages, realmoji, stealmoji, system info, message logger (buggy), nodelete (buggy) Angel utils (causes a crash when holding down on messages)

## #1

Okay, so first thing you should do is install some very important plugins. Use the plugin web browser on the discord for this. The first one is [hidegiftbutton](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/amsyarasyiq.github.io/letup/HideGiftButton/) (who uses those anyway) and optionally [hideappbutton](https://rico040.github.io/bunny-plugins/hideappbutton/). Both of these make your chatbox cleaner.
