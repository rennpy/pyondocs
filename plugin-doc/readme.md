## Plugin guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you used [CloudSync](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/vendetta.nexpid.xyz/cloud-sync/) on Vendetta, you should reinstall it and import your plugins. It is simply recommended looking at this guide for new ones you may like, and if a plugin is broken in case you have issues. (list provided above)

> First and foremost, if you are on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/pyoncord), look in the #faq channel for basic info on how to install plugins and/or themes. It 
won't be explained here, so please make sure you did.

Use the [plugin web browser](https://vd-plugins.github.io/web/#) for this. 

To get the links of the plugins, tap on their names listed below to open them in your browser (then copy the site url)

### Suggested plugins

| Plugin name | Description |
| --------- | :----------------------- |
| [HideGiftButton](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/amsyarasyiq.github.io/letup/HideGiftButton/) | Hides the gift button |
| [HideAppButton](https://rico040.github.io/bunny-plugins/hideappbutton/) | Hides the app cmds button |
| [HideVoiceButton](https://aliernfrog.github.io/vd-plugins/HideVoiceButton/) | Hides the voice message button |
| [ChatboxAvatar](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/cynosphere.github.io/VendettaPlugins/ChatboxAvatar/) | For a pfp and easy way to your profile within the chatbox |
| All of the above make the **chatbox** not an absolute mess. | (I'm looking at you, discord) |

Next up, [themes+](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/fres621.github.io/vendetta-plugins/BetterSearch/) is a must-have for **theme enjoyers**. If you want a way to set-up iconpacks for any theme, some are included within the plugin settings or you can use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rairof/discord-iconpacks/master/Packs/Plumpy/) for a fixed version of rosiecord plumpy! (dont use a suffix and remove the / at the start which themes+ weirdly does by default)

Lastly, for **better privacy**, I recommend another set of plugins;
| Plugin name | Description |
| --------- | :----------------------- |
| [CleanUrls](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/vendetta.nexpid/.xyz/clean-urls/) | Cleans tracking garbage from discord links |
| [HideTyping](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/redstonekasi.github.io/vendetta-plugins/no-typing/) | Hides typing |
| [AnonymousFileNames](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/maisymoe.github.io/strife/AnonymousFileNames/) | Generates random file names for anything you upload |

### Additional plugins

The rest of these dont matter as much, but I'll still list them here, since you *may* find something you like.

**FREE nitro** stuff;
| Plugin name | Description |
| --------- | :----------------------- |
| [Realmoji](https://vd-plugins.github.io/proxy/redstonekasi.github.io/vendetta-plugins/realmoji/) | Makes Freemoji look like actual emojis (not low quality pngs) |
