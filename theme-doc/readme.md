Here you can find most of the themes working with Pyoncord (more will be added in the future) and some quick links for theme developers.

> [!NOTE] 
> There is also a **list of compatible themes** with Pyoncord below

If this is your first time using a client mod, I suggest that you try [Pyontheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rennpy/pyontheme/main/pyontheme.json) (honestly, this is my guide so I can showcase what I want ðŸšŽ) <br>
You can be sure it will always work for most recent versions of Pyoncord, naturally.

Here is a link to the [github page](https://github.com/rennpy/pyontheme) for it, which includes a preview.

To get the raw links of the themes, hold on their names listed below to open the copy link prompt

## For theme developers

If you are a theme dev or want to try theme-making, you should look at the [theme docs](https://docs.riichi.tech/) from riichi (kinda outdated) <br>
And most importantly use [ThemeLings](https://github.com/nexpid/Themelings) by nexpid which is used to find new strings, semantic keys, raw colours and other strings along with icons discord changes or adds <br>

### Some suggestions
You should join the discord if you haven't already and ask in #theme-dev if you need help with anything.

Making your first theme might get a little complicated; take some breaks.

### Additional info

There currently isnt a channel for publishing themes yet, but once that is the case, reach out to cbani (me) within the discord server to make a submission via dms!

As for any already established theme-devs, keep me up to date with your themes, or even make a pull request to add/delete some of your themes to the list. I am open to improving this documentation as much as possible for the benefit of all pyoncord developers.

## Making themes for Pyoncord

This section will cover every aspect of a theme, and how you can make one yourself with enough time and effort. 

First, here is a complete overview of a .json theme file, this one being for Pyontheme. 

This is how the beginning section looks;

```json
{
    "name": "Pyontheme",
    "description": "Theme about Pyoncord (real and true)",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "rennpy",
            "id": "650805815623680030"
        }
   
```
As you can see, this is where you put your theme's name, description and author(s). Pretty simple, right?
