## Theme guide 

Here you can find most of the themes working with Pyoncord (more will be added in the future) and some quick links for theme developers.

If this is your first time using a client mod, I suggest that you try [Pyontheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rennpy/pyontheme/main/pyontheme.json) (honestly, this is my guide so I can showcase what I want ðŸšŽ) <br>
You can be sure it will always work for most recent versions of Pyoncord, naturally.

Here is a link to the [github page](https://github.com/rennpy/pyontheme) for it, which includes a preview.

### For theme developers

If you are a theme dev or want to try theme-making, you should look at the [theme docs](https://docs.riichi.tech/) from riichi (kinda outdated) <br>
And most importantly [ThemeLings](https://github.com/nexpid/Themelings) by nexpid which is used to find new icons discord changes or adds <br>
You should also join the discord if you haven't already and ask in #theme-dev if you need help with anything.
