Here you can find most of the themes working with Pyoncord (more will be added in the future) and some quick links for theme developers.

> [!NOTE] 
> There is also a **list of compatible themes** with Pyoncord below

If this is your first time using a client mod, I suggest that you try [Pyontheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rennpy/pyontheme/main/pyontheme.json) (honestly, this is my guide so I can showcase what I want ðŸšŽ) <br>
You can be sure it will always work for most recent versions of Pyoncord, naturally.

Here is a link to the [github page](https://github.com/rennpy/pyontheme) for it, which includes a preview.

To get the raw links of the themes, hold on their names listed below to open the copy link prompt

## For theme developers

If you are a theme dev or want to try theme-making, you should look at the [theme docs](https://docs.riichi.tech/) from riichi (kinda outdated) <br>
And most importantly use [ThemeLings](https://github.com/nexpid/Themelings) by nexpid which is used to find new strings, semantic keys, raw colours and other strings along with icons discord changes or adds <br>

### Some suggestions
You should join the discord if you haven't already and ask in #theme-dev if you need help with anything.

Making your first theme might get a little complicated; take some breaks.

### Additional info

There currently isnt a channel for publishing themes yet, but once that is the case, reach out to cbani (me) within the discord server to make a submission via dms!

As for any already established theme-devs, keep me up to date with your themes, or even make a pull request to add/delete some of your themes to the list. I am open to improving this documentation as much as possible for the benefit of all pyoncord developers.

## Making themes for Pyoncord

This section will cover every aspect of a theme, and how you can make one yourself with enough time and effort. 

First, here is a complete overview of a .json theme file, this one being for Pyontheme. 

### Description

This is how the beginning section looks;

```json
{
    "name": "Pyontheme",
    "description": "Theme about Pyoncord (real and true)",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "rennpy",
            "id": "650805815623680030"
        }
     ],
```
As you can see, this is where you put your theme's name, description and author(s). Pretty simple, right?

### Semantic colors

The following strings go over the semantic, or main colors;
```json
    "semanticColors": {
        "HEADER_PRIMARY": [
            "#d4d2ff"
        ],
        "HEADER_SECONDARY": [

        ],
        "BACKGROUND_NESTED_FLOATING": [
            "#2d2c48"
        ],

        "BACKGROUND_MESSAGE_HOVER": [
            "#26253b"
        ],
        "BACKGROUND_MODIFIER_HOVER": [
            "#26253b"
        ],
        "BACKGROUND_MODIFIER_ACTIVE": [
            "#2d2c48"
        ],
        "BACKGROUND_MODIFIER_SELECTED": [
            "#2d2c48"
        ],
        "BACKGROUND_MODIFIER_ACCENT": [
            "#2d2c48"
        ],
        "SCROLLBAR_THIN_THUMB": [
            "#26273b"
        ],
        "SCROLLBAR_THIN_TRACK": [
            "transparent"
        ],
        "SCROLLBAR_AUTO_THUMB": [
            "#6b68a3"
        ],
        "SCROLLBAR_AUTO_TRACK": [
            "#6b68a3"
        ],
        "CHANNELTEXTAREA_BACKGROUND": [
            "#26273b"
        ],
        "CHANNELS_DEFAULT": [
            "#5e5b8e"
        ],
        "TEXT_LINK": [
            "#6b68a3"
        ],
        "TEXT_DANGER": [
            "#6b68a3"
        ],
        "KEYBOARD": [
            "#161621"
        ],
        "BG_BACKDROP": [
            "#000000B2"
        ],
        "REDESIGN_BUTTON_SECONDARY_BACKGROUND": [
            "#26273b"
        ],
        "CHANNEL_ICON": [
            "#e0deff"
        ],
        "CHAT_BACKGROUND": [
            "#161621"
        ],
        "CARD_PRIMARY_BG": [
            "#2d2c48"
        ]
    },
   ```

This is where you will put all of the different hex colors. I recommend using image to hex converters for the best level of accuracy.

### Raw colors

After that follows the raw colors.
It can be a little trickier to figure out what they change, but they are also fairly important.
```json
    "rawColors": {
        "PRIMARY_500": "#9E8376",
        "PRIMARY_100": "#e0deff",
        "PRIMARY_200": "#d0cfef",
        "PRIMARY_300": "#5e5b8e",
        "PRIMARY_360": "#8884cc",
        "PRIMARY_400": "#8884cc",
        "PRIMARY_600": "#161621",
        "PRIMARY_630": "#161621",
        "PRIMARY_660": "#161621",
        "PRIMARY_700": "#161621",
        "PRIMARY_800": "#161621",
        "BLACK_500": "#000000B2",
        "BRAND_260": "#5e5b8e",
        "BRAND_360": "#a5a0f1",
        "BRAND_500": "#8884cc",
        "BRAND_560": "#8884cc",
        "YELLOW_300": "#a5a0f1",
        "GREEN_600": "#e0deff",
        "RED_400": "#938edc",
        "WHITE_500": "#e0deff",
        "GREEN_360": "#605d91",
        "PLUM_20": "#212034",
        "PLUM_17": "#26273b",
        "PLUM_13": "#26273b",
        "PLUM_16": "#2d2c48"

 },
```

### Background

And finally, at the end of the file is where you put the background (if needed);

> I recommend uploading the background directly to your theme's repo and copying the raw url so it can't be lost

```json
"background": {
        "blur": 0.1,
        "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rennpy/pyontheme/main/pyonpyon_bg.png"
    },
```
